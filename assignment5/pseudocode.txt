//problem 5.2a

let firstElem = 1234
let secondElem = 234
let sum = 0;
let tempSum = 0;

//need to multiply firstElem and secondElem

for i = 0 upto lengthof.firstElem
    for j = 0 upto lengthof.secondElem
        ans = firstElem[i] * secondElem[j]
        bitshift ans << j
        sum2 += ans;
    tempSum = ans << i;
    sum += tempSum;

//time complexity for one multiplicatin is n. There 
are two nested loops running n times, therefore,
time complexity is bigO (n^2).
