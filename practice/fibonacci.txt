// Naive algorithm

Fibonacci(n)
if n = 1 || n = 0
    return n
else
    return Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2)

T(n) = T(n-1)+T(n-2)+\theta(1)


Naive method:
complexity -> lower bounded by 2^n/2
Closed Form:
complexity -> lower bounded by (golden ratio)^n
           -> asymptotically bounded by (nlg) -> power of numbers approach
Bottom Up Method -> asymptotically bounded by n
Matrix Representation -> asymptotically bounded by nlgn
