BST algorithm

Assume all nodes are colored WHITE
Queue Q{}

start at node 0:
Q{0}
node0.color = GRAY
visit adjacent node 1
    Q{0, 1}
    adjacent node1.color = GRAY
visit adjacent node 2   
    Q{0, 1, 2}
    adjacent node3.color = GRAY 
Q{1, 2}
node0.color = BLACK 

at node 1:
look at adjacent node 2, the color is GRAY so no need to visit
look at adjacent node 3, the color is WHITE so we visit
visit adjacent node 3
    Q{1, 2, 3}
    adjacent node3.color = GRAY 
Q{2, 3}
node1.color = BLACK 

at node 2:
look at adjacent node 3, the color is GRAY so no need to visit
Q{3}
node2.color = BLACK 

at node 3:
look at adjacent node 4, the color is WHITE so we visit
visit adjacent node 4
    Q{3, 4}
    node4.color = GRAY 
Q{4}
node3.color = BLACK 

at node 4:
look at adjacent node 0, color is BLACK so we do not visit
look at adjacent node 0, color is BLACK so we do not visit
look at adjacent node 5, color is WHITE so we visit
visit adjacent node 5
    Q{4, 5}
    node 5.color = GRAY 
Q{5}
node4.color = BLACK

at node 5:
no adjacent nodes
Q{}
node5.color = BLACK 

Therefore we have visited all the nodes!
